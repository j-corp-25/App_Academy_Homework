3 important parts of the react context API

  - A component provider that is used ti wrap other components in order to give access to the contexts value. In our
    case, we will wrap the entire applciation
- Consumer

- Context
  - Allos "global" data in a react application and stores a single value
    - `createContext()` - creates a global object
    - `useContext()` - consumes that global information
