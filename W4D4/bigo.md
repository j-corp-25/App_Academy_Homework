# Big-O

## The term of fastest algois determined by how many steps it take

## Asymptotic Anlysis

> How we describe the behaviour of a line as it approaches an infinite n.

### We ignore constants when we are doing Asymptotic analysis and the most dominant term wins

Any constant gets reduce to 1 no matter how big it is. In a situation of 3n + 1 for the number of steps. you remove 3 and 1 just leaving  n.

## Your algo is as fast as your bottleneck(slowest)
